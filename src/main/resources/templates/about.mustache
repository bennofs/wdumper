<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
    This tool provides a simple interface to create customized RDF dumps from Wikidata.
    It is based on <a href="https://github.com/Wikidata/Wikidata-Toolkit">Wikidata Toolkit</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The dumping process logically consists of two steps. First, the entities to export are determined.
    Those entities are then exported according to the rules.
    This step uses the rules for statements to determine what to export for each statement of the selected entity.
    In addition to the statements, you can also control what other information is exported for the selected entity,
    such as labels.
</p>
<p>
    When you submit a request for a dump, it is added to the queue. You can view
    the current queue status <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/wdumps/status">here</a>.
